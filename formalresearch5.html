			<h1>Analysis of Trade Article</h1>
			<p>A major article that went into this research paper is a trade publication named It Advances in Radiology by Lee Ann Runy. After further review the article focuses on the productivity and improvement of radiology with in the past decade. It also criticizes the implication of radiology devices in hospitals and how they are being underutilized. If hospitals are able to invest in more medical imaging technology and more into radiology research, the growth of diagnostic could provide better help to patients. It could provide better care and also reduce expenses while increasing productivity.

This was one of the images in the article and it shows the increase in number of procedures done in the United States. The public trade article is very important to see as it shows that radiology is a very essential career in the future. If hospitals are able to invest in this field and research, health care can become a better organizations.
