		<h1><strong>Breaking an arm</strong></h1>
		<p>      College is a gateway for a millions of people to earn a degree and get an education towards a career they dream of. There are hundreds of majors and minors, students will peruse and they will work through multiple years of hard education to earn a degree. There are also new majors that have been focused around computers and studying technology. Technology influences a large part of all of our lives, whether it be a simple phone or a MRI scanner that could be used to save hundreds of lives. Deciding a major plays an important part in students’ lives and a great deal of our decisions revolve around technology. With advancements every day there are many majors that have changed around the new technology.  I currently go to Michigan State University in pursuit of a human biology major. My goal is to go to medical school and become a radiologist. Radiology is the study of radiation and involves several complex machines, which have been created through the growth of technology. Technology has shaped my decision and through life events, I have decided to become a human biology major in pursuit of a medical degree in radiology.</p>
		<p>      Radiology is an important breakthrough in medical advancements, as it has allowed people to look inside a human’s body without any invasive procedures. An x-ray a part of radiology and is a diagnostic tool that uses radiation to shine light that goes through the human but is unable to go through dense material like bones. The light reflects off the bones and allows the device to be able to record the amount of reflected light to view the insides of the body. The career requires a lot of knowledge about the human body, it also requires a lot of knowledge about the machines that are being used. X-rays are such advance piece of technology that takes a look inside of the human body and since you are unable to physically interact with body a doctor has to assume what is going on. X-ray devices are absolutely required at hospitals now and are used hundreds of times on a daily basis. I found my major, Human Biology, a perfect major that would work with my goal in becoming a radiologist. Human biology is the study of the human body and to become a radiologist you have to know every bone and every organ. It is also requires a person to know how those parts work and what those parts are made of. Human biology teaches one about many parts of the human body such as, the cardiovascular system and the digestive system. Radiology takes a look at the inside of the human body and since you are unable to physically interact with body a doctor has to assume what is going on. Human biology and radiology go hand and hand and with technology people are able to use their knowledge to diagnose what is wrong with an injured patient. </p>
		<p>      When I was younger I was quite prone to injuries. I was quite reckless and hurt myself a handful of times so I ended up in the hospital a lot. As a child I didn’t know any better, so a trip anywhere was quite fun. When I was about four years old I was messing around on a slide and somehow fell off the top and landed in a rough position. I ended up breaking my arm and earned myself a trip to the radiology department. Once arriving in the hospital I waited in a room with multiple large pieces of glass surrounding me. I was asked a bunch of questions by the nurse and I tried to answer as best as a four year old can. I didn’t know what was going on but I had a lead vest given to me by a nurse. I laid down on a flatbed looking around the room while the cameras flashed and took pictures of my injured arm. After a few hours laying down in awkward positions I was able to get up, and see what had happen to my arm after I fell from the slide. Soon after a doctor came in to put a cast on me, I was in awe and in pain the entire time. I don’t know what was going on back than but I believe that this experience was the beginning of my interest towards radiology. To be able to see such amazing equipment was extremely fascinating and it provided me with early look into my future decision of becoming a radiologist. I was able to get a firsthand experience with an x-ray and was able to get a close look at huge devices that are used to help human’s lives. </p>
		<p>      Growing up I dueled enrolled at Farris University in high school, with the Kent ISD program. It is an early college program that allowed students to get special education towards a career. I enrolled with the medical program and through this course I was able to job shadow at Metro-Health Hospital. Of course I was interested into the radiology department every Friday I would spend two hours with either the technologist or the head doctors. This was where I was able to spend time using the x-rays. I learned a lot of about this technology and I learned about how much it has changed since I broke my arm. There are new devices such as MRI’s and CAT scans that provide a more detailed look at more important human body parts, such as the heart or the brain. I was allowed to see all this technology in progress and saw how amazing it was. I was able to see what goes on and the process that patients have to follow. For example if a patient has a stomach issue, the nurses will issue a chemical that illuminates the stomach when swallowed. The x-ray machine is able to shine a light and doctors are able to see the problems within the stomach. This technology has helped me gain even more interest towards deciding my professional career track. During my I followed a doctor named Dr. David Patrick, he has been an inspiration to me and has helped me decide my major. He told me all about his college life and what he went through, he was actually a biology major as well. </p>
		<p>      After my first experience and after high school I knew what my dream and my goal was, it was to become a radiologist and the first step was to find a major. I believed that human biology is perfect for my decision and will help me become a radiologist. Through life experiences I have decided to pursue my current major in Human biology. After being able to use x-ray machines and taking an extensive look at an advance technology I found the exactly what I was looking for. With radiology continuing to grow I hope to see many more changes that can benefit humans and provide a better look inside a person. My goal is to finish under-grad school and be accepted to medical school. Technology has influenced my life and has influenced my decision in college and I believe it is guiding me to the right path. </p>
