			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Technology has grown at an outstanding rate and has helped improve the massive fields of medicine. The diagnostic field is one of them, radiology is a diagnostic specialty growing from the technological advancements made for the common good. The basic idea of radiology is being able to view the inner body parts of people without surgically cutting into them, using various types of equipment. Radiologists are the doctors who examine patients to diagnose illnesses and they also provide information to other doctors. Some radiologists even interact with their patients and treat their illnesses. Radiology is a new and growing field, with many years of schooling it is a very successful career to hold.  A quote from Professor Norman, Geoffrey R. say that “From a global perspective, diagnostic radiology is part of a larger system that has as its goal effective and efficient treatment of patients.” Radiology is an important academic discipline that requires many students to research and is needed in the medical world. The practice of radiology is based on observation and focuses on, evidence based study and critical thinking. In order to understand the practice, research is required for students to better understand the methods. In the past two decades radiology has expanded to an extreme amount and research in the field has also grown.  From 2000 to 2002 the number of CT scan procedures grew from 14million to almost 22 million and continues to grow at an exponential rate (itadvances2014). The road to become a radiologist is long but the rewards are great and also provide a lot of wisdom. Students must be prepared for many long hours of work and a lot of time spent studying. Radiology is a new and necessary academic discipline that is important for people to be informed in and research will continue to grow. </p>
