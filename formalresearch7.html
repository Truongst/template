			<h1>Analysis of Article- Core Curriculum</h1>
			<p>In radiology, one must be able to “identify, formulate and problem solve to answer questions and grasp the basic concept and principles to validate its usefulness” written in the scholarly article A Core Curriculum in Evaluating Sciences for Diagnostic Imaging by Norman, Geoffrey R. Radiology students must be able to focus on their specialties and understand how to use the technology today. It is important that students that are going through studies in radiology understand the steps to take to become a radiologist and the qualities needed.  Starting from college years there a lot of possible courses and majors to take, to become a radiologist a student has to go through four years of college then four years of medical school. While in medical school they are required to take at least a year of internship in the field they practice. Following medical school there is four years of radiology residency which is considered one of the most important part in gaining skills to become a radiologist. The article presents possible curriculum for students to increase their knowledge in radiology. Norman mentions that studying evaluating sciences is a basic study that is necessary as a radiology. To have the quality to read and understands charts is an important quality to have. Also being able to understand the statistics and concepts to approaching data is extremely useful. Another class recommended is economics, when resources are scarce, choices must be made on how the resources should be dispersed. When students enter college, courses towards radiology will be based around analysis, economics and research. The road to become a radiologist is a long path and requires a lot of work and studying but the reward will be enormous.</p>
