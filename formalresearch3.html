			<h1>What is Radiology</h1>
		<p>When a person breaks his or her arm the first thing that doctors will put the patient through is an x-ray. X-rays and many other imaging items form the basis of radiology. A physician in radiology is called a radiologist and they are the doctors who assess the injuries of people using special equipment. There are even more sub-specialties within the normal studies including x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, Nuclear, and more. The most common is X-rays also known as projectional or fluoroscopy radiography. Projectional radiography involves quick x-ray radiation to form a two-dimensional images that allows doctors to view bone structure. These quick radiation X-rays are used in most fields of the medication, such as dentistry. Fluoroscopy is another basic type of x-rays using a chemicals that can be given orally or injected and it allows doctors to make organs more florescent allowing the radiation to appear on film. For example a person might have an inflamed stomach and after taking a chemical the machine will allow a detailed picture of a person digestive tract (Newsmedical2013). Another imaging sub-specialty is CT scanning, which is uses x-ray with computer algorithms to create an image of the body. It is a round shape machine that rotates around the patients to take cross sectional images of the body and creates a three dimensional look inside the body. There are a lot of downsides to CT scans as it produces more radiation that can harm a patient but with correct technique the chances are very slim. The number of CT scanning’s have increased due to its very quick and accurate scans.  In addition to x-rays and CT scans there is magnetic resonance imaging which uses strong magnetic fields to align atomic nuclei within the body tissues (NewsMedical2013). With this MRI’s provide the best images to look at patient’s soft tissue. This technology makes it easier to look at parts of the body without radiation, a common place that is scanned is the brain which is susceptible to radiation. Not only does it provide a better look at the tissues it is able to create a three dimensional image for doctors to look at. Another common diagnostic tool is ultrasound, which uses high frequency sound waves to visualize soft tissue in the body in real time. There is no radiation, no disturbance of the cells so it is perfect for pregnant women. The sounds will reflect off tissues at certain frequencies and give radiologist an ability to see inside the human. Ultrasound is very limited and is not very detailed, it is unable to go through air such as air within the lungs. The reason it is so often used is how safe it is, it does not obstruct any parts compared to all other forms of radiology. The last medical diagnostic tool and sub-specialty is nuclear medicine. The amount of nuclear operations has increase due to the amount of cancer and diseases that have appeared within the last few decades. Nuclear radiology consist of using high amounts of radioactive material to treat certain patients with diseased tissues or on specific cells. It is the most dangerous diagnostic tools and can kill many cells in the body. All these specialties of radiology make up the diagnostic medicine. Radiology plays a major part in human health and medicine.<p>
