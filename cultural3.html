In the gaming world of League of Legends players will control these powerful characters and make them fight in order to reach the nexus and become victorious. There is all kinds of players that play league of legends, from athletes to kids to teachers to girls the variety is endless. It is currently the most popular online game in the world and has a huge impact on society. The video game puts five champions against five others and the team who can kill the enemy nexus (base) wins. League of Legends is a MOBA or multiplayer online battle arena which is a real-time strategy game that requires a lot of actions per minute (APM). Some players are able to reach almost 600 actions per minute, meaning they are able to click and tap buttons ten times in one second. The average player in league of legends can have around 200 APM (NBCNEWS2014). This requires a lot of quick finger movements that causes stress to the body and also causes a lot injuries. League of Legend also requires a lot of time to invest. Each game last for about forty five minutes and the entire time players are completely immersed into the game. Every second of the game counts of every moment matters so players can’t leave the screen for a single second and players can play multiple games every day. “Rank” play is a huge part of the system that allows player to place their skill against other players at that level. Rank games require a lot of time to climb the “ladder” and be placed at a better skill level (RiotGaming, 2013). Some people will invest all their time to try to climb and sometimes they may not even get anywhere. Online games have grown extremely fast and it has not only a game to few it is a reality. Some see games as a living, they see it as a better life, with no repercussions and no issues.
