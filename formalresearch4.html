			<h1>Growth of Radiology</h1>
			<p>With the baby boom generation slowly ageing the need of health care is exponentially growing. The Healthcare cost in the United States is predicted to soon exceed 20% of the gross domestic product (ACR2012). Due to the increase in healthcare spending, medical imaging has also rose and because it is used for most of the other medical fields spending in medical imaging has increased more than others. The growth in radiology is an important factor in health care as it helps provide the best care for patients who need it. As developments are made radiology has increased the productivity of the health field and has also provided better care for patients. For example in emergencies previously surgery would be used to access the patient, but with radiology, it is quick and painless to find what is wrong with a patient. Another factor for the growth of radiology is the liability issues. Doctors face many decisions and some of the can be crucial to one’s life, so it is important that they find out the issue with accuracy. The use of radiology has given doctors a safer and more liable way to save a patient’s life without as many problems. Radiology is an important part of healthcare and will continue to grow and save the lives of many.</p>
