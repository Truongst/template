A player name Chen Rong-yu recently died after playing league of legends for more than 23 hours in one period! He was found in a very popular video game café in Taipei and reports say that his arms were still stretched out with his hands on the keyboard and mouse (Mirrornews2012). As video games such as league of legends get better and better, more and more people will begin to face video game addiction. Some of the most common issues is carpel tunnel syndrome, which is a disease that effects the median nerve that runs from the arm to the wrist, which causes inflammation or may completely restrict movement of the fingers. It is usually caused from repeated movements of the joints or a lot of work pressure. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common injuries in professional gaming. Another big issue that League of Legend is the cause of many social issues for children or even college students.

League of Legends and the players that play video games face a major problem and video addiction will grow as technology develops.</p>
				<li><a href="cultural5.html">Proposed Solution</a></li>
				<p>In order to solve this issue many rules need to be put in place and areas to help show parents steps to fight video game addiction. Some will say that it is easy to cold turkey video games but it is not. Video games has been found to be more addictive than gambling and it can really harm a person to immediately quit. To propose a solution, it is best for League of Legends should put a number of hours a player can play in a period. Currently a person can play non-stop but to allow this would be terrible for one’s health.  Suggesting a number of hours allowed to play will allow people who wish to play casual possible and restrict players who spend more than 12+ hours a day. Also putting a notice within the game to show how long a person is playing can effect what people think about when they are in game. According to Dr. John M. Grohol it is important to “ Track your video game use, to help better control the amount of time spent playing” (Psychcentral 2007).  If many video game companies were to put in place these limits it would not only provide a more positive outlook for video gamers it would also protect people who are obsessive over a game. League of Legends would be a great start to this as it is one of the largest online game played today. Another possible proposal is to introduce classes for parents to help prevent video game addiction to young kids. Most of the community that face video game addiction are kids who have plenty of free time and waste it on video games. So it is important for the adult who control the kids to limit their time playing games. It is also needed to have parents help children with their social abilities and let the go outside and get interaction with other kids. Having a good base for students playing video games is really important as these habits will help them control their addiction. With these rules in place it is possible to reduce the number of video gaming addictions and reduce the number of injuries related to playing games.</p>
