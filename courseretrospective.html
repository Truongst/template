			<h1>Courseretrospective</h1>
			<p>	Writing: Science and technology (WRA110) is a course that will challenge your abilities to research and reflect on what you are learning. It is a great course if you are interested in how to use technology to improve your writing and also to look at how technology effects your future career. Technology plays a major part in this course and each project requires us to reflect how we can incorporate technology with your writing. There were four major projects the cultural analysis proposal, the formal research project, and the multimedia remix project. Each one focuses on helping you develop your writing skills, interviewing skills, and researching skills. These assignments have been helpful in improving my writing skills and would help you as well. Writing: Science and Technology also has a few homework assignments between each major project and that helped me get an idea on how to write a paper. In order to be successful in WRA 110 you have to understand what you are looking up and preparing yourself to write a paper.
	The first thing that will be brought up in class is your personal profile. It is a small website that will consist of all your future papers and blogs. When creating your website you be using a website that will host it called Github. Github makes it easy to organize your different documents and website codes. In class you will be given a template to use and it is an amazing place to start your personal profile. Using a template you will build your website and set up areas where you can copy and paste your papers to publish what you have written. Then you can change the style and look of it to fit your personality. Another small assignment given to you will be the blog which will be written in the personal profile. This consist of fifteen short entries that you will write during your time in the class. These blogs will help you reflect on your time during WRA 110.  The blog will help you in the final project the course retrospective because it helps you reflect on your past thoughts on previous papers. The blog is a great assignment as it will improve your individual literacy and will show your improvements within the last semester.
Following the blog and github the first major assignment introduced is the Lived Experience assignment that ask you to explain how technology is important in your major. It also ask you to introduce your major using personal experiences to help give readers a better visual aid in reading about that major. I wrote about radiology which is one of my major goals in the future so there was a lot for me to write about. The project begins with a drafting activity that ask you to think about how your story is going to incorporate with the assignment. It also focuses on what the assignment is about and how technology has impacted your academic career path. Furthermore it makes you analyze how your life episode would relate to technology and the prompt. The drafting really help set me up to write the Lived Experience project. After the draft you will begin writing the Lived experience paper. This paper will challenge you in your ability to describe an anecdote and give readers an interesting story to read. It will make you think about how this anecdote has made you be who you are. It will show you why you chose your major and what you have in mind for the future. To me writing this paper was the easiest to write about as it included a life experience to my current career goal. I wrote about the time where I broke my arm and went to the doctor to get an x-ray. This reflects on my goal in becoming a radiologist and studying hard to be the person that gives people x-rays. The Lived Experience assignment is a good place to start for the class as it makes you think about your studies.
The next major project is the cultural analysis paper. This paper looks at a social issue that is caused by technology. The big idea of this assignment is to take a video, a game, or a piece of technology and analyze all the issue that come from it. In the first day of class we spent time watching a south park episode and this gave us an example at how society has depicted video game players. It made fun of how addicted kids will play video games for hours with no benefit. This video is a good example on how technology has affected the lives of gamers and makes you analyze the issue at hand. The cultural analysis paper will focus on the topic you choose and requires you to conduct research in order to better understand what the problem is. When conducting my paper I wrote about a game that I play a lot league of legends and since I play the game a lot I understand what issues come from the game and it made the paper easier to write. I found that this assignment spent a good amount of time looking at how well you will examine an issue and sets you up well for the next assignments.  
The third project given to you will be the longest, the formal research paper. This takes a look at a specific academic discipline and requires you to investigate deep into it. The assignment requires you to create knowledge for readers on the function, communication, and roles of technology in the academic discipline. It also requires you to look at a couple of ways of research. First type of research is given in the draft the assignment. The draft assignment looks at a couple of scholarly article and a couple of trade publications to read and study them, then has you incorporate them into your paper. When studying I found that it was very helpful and I learned more about my major. I also got a lot of facts and graphs I didn’t know about. This part of the assignment is very beneficial in your learning ability and teaches you a lot about how you study. The next part of the assignment will have you conduct an interview on a professional working in the academic discipline and on a professor or a person who teaches. This is one of the more interesting parts of the assignment. I contacted a doctor in a hospital and a professor here at Michigan State University. The most challenging part will be finding time to call and meet up with these professionals and when you are able to contact them you have to be prepared in a professional manner to talk to them. Preparation is important when conducting an interview, you have to know what questions you are going to ask and you have to know how you are going to soak in the information. A lot of times you won’t have time to write down the information, so you have to know what your interviewee is saying. The last part of the assignment going to write about how all of this fits together. In this assignment it is important that you look at how technology fits in. It makes you think about not only the things you study it teaches you how to connect it to your paper. I found this paper the most beneficial to my knowledge of my future career.
The last major assignment given you will be the multi-media remix project. This project looks at your ability to work with groups and it looks at how you can be creative. The assignment takes a group of people and as a group you will have to create a documentary of one of your past assignments. Before the assignment began we watched a documentary that helped us plan our project out, it gave us an idea how to organize a video. It focused on building information into a climax and then a conclusion. In my group we used the cultural analysis video as it would have been the most interesting for our group. When working with groups you have to know how to interact with each other and one person has to take the lead in order to everyone together. In my group we found it really hard to have time for each other as we all had classes and some of us had sports or priorities. Group work is very important aspect of the project because it is very hard to create a video without any help. This assignment helps you suck in the past information you have built upon and created visual. 
Writing: science and technology is a great class to test your abilities and build your knowledge. Over the course I have learned a lot and have improved my writing. This improvement is based on how the four assignments worked together in order to have students grow. To be successful in WRA: 110 you have to be immerged in the assignments and take your time reviewing what you study.
