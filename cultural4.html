			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>There are multiple issues to face within the video gaming community and addiction plays a major part. Video gaming addiction is recently a new disorder, created by the growing technology, has been classified by AMA or American Medical Association as a diagnostic and statistical mental disorder. According to Video-game-addiction.org nearly 10% of people who play video games exhibit addictive behavior towards video games and the same statistic is true about league of legends. A player name Chen Rong-yu recently died after playing league of legends for more than 23 hours in one period! He was found in a very popular video game caf√© in Taipei and reports say that his arms were still stretched out with his hands on the keyboard and mouse (Mirrornews2012). As video games such as league of legends get better and better, more and more people will begin to face video game addiction. Some of the most common issues is carpel tunnel syndrome, which is a disease that effects the median nerve that runs from the arm to the wrist, which causes inflammation or may completely restrict movement of the fingers. It is usually caused from repeated movements of the joints or a lot of work pressure. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common injuries in professional gaming. Another big issue that League of Legend is the cause of many social issues for children or even college students. In a study in United States 89% of addicted video gamers are linked with anxiety, depression, and social phobia. Also they suffered lower grades and usually had difficulties escaping their problems (CNN 2011). After looking into the forums on league of legends there were a lot of stories of people that mention their lives were ruined by the game. One particular story was interesting (Link below). It was about a player that played League of Legends that would lie to his friends about playing games and played anyway.  He also mentioned bad grades, and detachment from the outside world. League of Legends and the players that play video games face a major problem and video addiction will grow as technology develops.</p>
