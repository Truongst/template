		<p>	My experience with the multi-media remix project was sub-par I did not enjoy it at all. When deciding for our issue it was simple to pick. We wanted to pick a one of our group’s assignment that seemed very simple to do. So we decided to make a smart phone cultural analysis paper. I actually learned quite a bit about the issue. I have read about some interesting facts that about smart phones that have recently came about in the last decade and I got to better understand how it has affected me and the community. I learned that it plays a huge part in the community and after reading my group mates assignment it got me thinking about how much I use my smartphone. We had a lot of problems organizing and composing our documentary because everyone was busy but everyone wanted to put their part in the video. So we decided to split up the project into 5 parts an intro, about a smartphone, issues and a resolution and a conclusion. This means that we weren’t together and the overall movie did not flow that well. For our audience we wanted them to see how smart phones affected the community and we wanted to show how they use there smartphones every day.  As in audience we recorded people we saw using their smartphones and let them join in with interviews and interactive questions.
	The process of deciding the topic was really easy, Andrew Franko had a very simple cultural analysis paper that we believe would be easy to reenact and create a documentary. In my opinion our group coordination was not that great and I put a lot of work onto myself by directing and editing and writing a script for the video. Everyone else put their part though so it was easy to make the video. We did take a systematic approach we split each part of the video for each group member and that way one person would focus on an area. 
	The paper was the biggest source of information for the project and it helped us decided what to write. Andrew had links in his paper that gave us information on cellphones and it was really helpful. We did not really look into many other resources besides the paper for information because we thought it would be enough. It was difficult to meet with the group and since everyone was busy we never met so it was hard to get anything done. Also I decided to put myself in a position of leadership and tried my best to get anything done.  I did not enjoy working in groups for a project like this because we had no time together it was really awkward making a video and also I would have preferred working alone on a video. I enjoy group work but not when it is with people I don’t know well and I don’t get time to talk to them.
	We met up at the library once a week for this project for about an hour or so. There was not a lot of planning besides creating a script on google docs then having people read it and recording a video of interviews. If I had one more time to do this project again I would have preferred to have different group member or just doing it alone. Also if we had more time together we could have had a better time making the video. 
	The most effective aspect of our documentary is the information because we split each area for each person it was really easy to research an area. One person would have an issue and he could easily read about all the problems and one person read about the smartphone etc. We designed our project like a documentary by splitting each part into action sequences and bringing out the issue as a climax.
