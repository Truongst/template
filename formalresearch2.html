			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Humans are fragile creatures that are prone to injury and considering that the human population continues to grow more and more people will become ridden with disease and wounds. Thus the creation of modern medicine; that is used to treat diseases and injuries. There are a multiple areas within modern medicine that are used to treat people, yet none can be compared to the diagnostic specialty. The medical definition of diagnostics can be described as a method to distinguish or identify an issue. Over the past century technology has grown at an outstanding rate and has been an important part in healthcare.  One specific field that has grown from technology and is used in the diagnostic specialty is radiology. The basic idea of radiology is being able to view the inner body parts of people without surgically cutting into them, using various types of equipment. Due to the equipment, radiology is capable of many different forms of diagnostics and research. This research paper is going to focus on the basic medical uses and provide insight in what radiology is and also show what steps it takes to become a radiologist.</p>
