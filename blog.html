                        <h1>Blog Entry #1 "It get's better"</h1>
                        <p> Today in class we watched a video by Randy Roberts Potts on his Uncle Ronnie. In the video he reads us a poem explaining his story about his gay uncle that committed Suicide after a divorce and when people realized that he was gay. The video was extremely emotional and it was really quite serious. I had a friend that committed suicide back and high school and it has been a ride ever since. I havenâ€™t been the same and I will always remember her. The video uses a very detail description about how his events related to his cousins and gave listeners an intense insight of how he was feeling. The people watching the video could understand his message immediately. After watching the video I will add more emotion and description into my anecdote to make the readers more interested in reading and finding out about my story.
