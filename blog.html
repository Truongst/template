                        <h1>Blog Entry #1 "It get's better"</h1>
                        <p> Today in class we watched a video by Randy Roberts Potts on his Uncle Ronnie. In the video he reads us a poem explaining his story about his gay uncle that committed Suicide after a divorce and when people realized that he was gay. The video was extremely emotional and it was really quite serious. I had a friend that committed suicide back and high school and it has been a ride ever since. I haven’t been the same and I will always remember her. The video uses a very detail description about how his events related to his cousins and gave listeners an intense insight of how he was feeling. The people watching the video could understand his message immediately. After watching the video I will add more emotion and description into my anecdote to make the readers more interested in reading and finding out about my story.

                        <h1>Blog Entry #2 "MLK Day blog"</h1>
                        <p>It was our first day off from WRA 110. I decided to go home for the 3 day weekend and hang out with my friends. I Also wanted to finish my lived experience project. For my Lived experience project I decided to work on one of my favorite topics radiology. When I was a kid I broke my arm multiple times and those were very memorable moments. So it was really easy to write about my interest. The assignment is due on january 27 and i will be ready.  </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #3 World of warcraft</h1>
                        <p> Today we watched the south park episode about World of Warcraft. The video focuses on kids who have no lives and spend multiple hours playing wow and they have one goal. To defeat a player that has been going around killing everyone. There are a lot of social issues from this episode, one is how kids the will play games and miss a lot of activities they could be doing. Also that they could get carpel tunnel from playing way to many games. The writer of the story, identifies a lot of the problems that come from playing a video games. He critiques them by creating fictional characters that have all these issues and mocks them for viewers to watch and laugh. He makes humiliating scenes to degrade the issues from playing too much games. </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #4 Continuing the cultural analysis project</h1>
                        <p> Today in class we didn't do much. The class was given time to work on the cultural analysis assignment so I started to finish my draft. My project is going to be about my favorite game league of legends. I think I have a slight addiction to video games so writing about video game addiction was slightly enlightning. I spend atleast 3 to 4 hours everyday playing games and i say up extremely late every night. I think it was good to reflect on how much games i have been playing.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #5 Gun Threat</h1>
                        <p> This is one scary blog, Today we dropped class and everyone left because of a gun threat at the building we had class. Pretty much my first reaction was to write about it on my facebook, which probably isn't a good idea but we weren't doing anything else in class. Everyone was freaking out and blocking the doors and turning off  the lights like a highschool lock down. After 30 minuites or so everyone recived another text telling people that it was a false alert. The gun carrier was holding a training weapon that was allowed and was just walking around to class with it. Even though it wasn't real it was really scary to see everyone freak out and worrying about getting shot. I honestly wouldn't know what to do if it was a real threat. I need to prepare myself for the next time.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #6 Moter city "Detroit"</h1>
                        <p>Today in class we watched the Chrysler commercial on their new Chrysler 200. The video was a speech on what Detroit is and shows where Chrysler comes from. The video was actually considered as one of the best commercials during the 2011 super bowl and just represents what the Motor City is. It begins with multiple dark views yet beautiful scenery of downtown Detroit and continues to show the elegance of what Detroit is. It continues by intensifying the mood of the commercial by including a song by a Detroit legend Eminem “Lose Yourself”.  The song and the scene brings out the importance of the video extremely well but what really stands out was the voice over. The speech was inspirational and not only that it was so good that just hearing it once made audience really think about Detroit. Finally to end everything they include a tag “Imported From Detroit” which gave audience something remember, something to stick in there head. This video was amazing and may continue to be one of the best car shown on television so far.</p>
