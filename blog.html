                        <h1>Blog Entry #1 "It get's better"</h1>
                        <p> Today in class we watched a video by Randy Roberts Potts on his Uncle Ronnie. In the video he reads us a poem explaining his story about his gay uncle that committed Suicide after a divorce and when people realized that he was gay. The video was extremely emotional and it was really quite serious. I had a friend that committed suicide back and high school and it has been a ride ever since. I haven’t been the same and I will always remember her. The video uses a very detail description about how his events related to his cousins and gave listeners an intense insight of how he was feeling. The people watching the video could understand his message immediately. After watching the video I will add more emotion and description into my anecdote to make the readers more interested in reading and finding out about my story.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #2 "MLK Day blog"</h1>
                        <p>It was our first day off from WRA 110. I decided to go home for the 3 day weekend and hang out with my friends. I Also wanted to finish my lived experience project. For my Lived experience project I decided to work on one of my favorite topics radiology. When I was a kid I broke my arm multiple times and those were very memorable moments. So it was really easy to write about my interest. The assignment is due on january 27 and i will be ready.  </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #3 World of warcraft</h1>
                        <p> Today we watched the south park episode about World of Warcraft. The video focuses on kids who have no lives and spend multiple hours playing wow and they have one goal. To defeat a player that has been going around killing everyone. There are a lot of social issues from this episode, one is how kids the will play games and miss a lot of activities they could be doing. Also that they could get carpel tunnel from playing way to many games. The writer of the story, identifies a lot of the problems that come from playing a video games. He critiques them by creating fictional characters that have all these issues and mocks them for viewers to watch and laugh. He makes humiliating scenes to degrade the issues from playing too much games. </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #4 Continuing the cultural analysis project</h1>
                        <p> Today in class we didn't do much. The class was given time to work on the cultural analysis assignment so I started to finish my draft. My project is going to be about my favorite game league of legends. I think I have a slight addiction to video games so writing about video game addiction was slightly enlightning. I spend atleast 3 to 4 hours everyday playing games and i say up extremely late every night. I think it was good to reflect on how much games i have been playing.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #5 Gun Threat</h1>
                        <p> This is one scary blog, Today we dropped class and everyone left because of a gun threat at the building we had class. Pretty much my first reaction was to write about it on my facebook, which probably isn't a good idea but we weren't doing anything else in class. Everyone was freaking out and blocking the doors and turning off  the lights like a highschool lock down. After 30 minuites or so everyone recived another text telling people that it was a false alert. The gun carrier was holding a training weapon that was allowed and was just walking around to class with it. Even though it wasn't real it was really scary to see everyone freak out and worrying about getting shot. I honestly wouldn't know what to do if it was a real threat. I need to prepare myself for the next time.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry #6 Moter city "Detroit"</h1>
                        <p>Today in class we watched the Chrysler commercial on their new Chrysler 200. The video was a speech on what Detroit is and shows where Chrysler comes from. The video was actually considered as one of the best commercials during the 2011 super bowl and just represents what the Motor City is. It begins with multiple dark views yet beautiful scenery of downtown Detroit and continues to show the elegance of what Detroit is. It continues by intensifying the mood of the commercial by including a song by a Detroit legend Eminem “Lose Yourself”.  The song and the scene brings out the importance of the video extremely well but what really stands out was the voice over. The speech was inspirational and not only that it was so good that just hearing it once made audience really think about Detroit. Finally to end everything they include a tag “Imported From Detroit” which gave audience something remember, something to stick in there head. This video was amazing and may continue to be one of the best car shown on television so far.</p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #7 Formal Research</h1>
                        <p>The following assignment that we had to do was the formal research project. I found this project to be the most boring and longest, as it took a lot of time. Our drafting assignment was to spend time looking at scholar articles and write down what they bring to our research paper. I really like the website that was given to us, proquest. I am most likely going to use it more and hopefully that will provide me with better information.</p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #8 Codec Academy</h1>
                        <p>Codecacademy was one of my more favorite assignments as I really like computers. Some of the assignments were extremely long and tedious though so it slightly was a drag. I spent more time working on customizing my portfolio then I did on codecacadmy. Some of the assignments in it were pretty cool, making a css page and learning about how simple it is to make paragraph’s using <p></p>.  I learned to make my background a picture and also position it to fit the page without ruining the photo. After making the website I will probably try to make another one for myself using github. </p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #9 Spring break</h1>
                        <p>Spring break was fun. This was our next time I had free time. It gave me time to finish my Formal research project and it also gave me time to work on my codec academy. For spring break I went home again and it was my friend’s birthday so I hung out with him.  For spring break I also looked around my grades and looked at how I was doing this semester. It wasn’t really a good sign. My grades weren’t as good as hoped and I have been really stressed out. I am averaging around 2.5-3.5 in all my classes but since I plan to go to med school I really want to be above 3.5. I haven’t gotten a 4.0 all year so I have been slightly nervous about my future. Hopefully I will do better next year.</p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #10 Remix project 1</h1>
                        <p>The remix project was the next assignment Day 1 was interesting, we spent time in class to watch a video and we wasn’t assigned out groups yet. We watched a mythology documentary video which I happen to see already in one of my high school class. So it wasn’t new but it is always interesting. The topic was on aliens giving humans the technological needs in the past to provide healthcare. I honestly thought the whole thing was fake and not plausible. I think that humans are naturally curious and try to make these high tech equipment to help people. They also lied about stories back then about prophets etc. Today’s class was pretty interesting. </p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #11 Remix project 2</h1>
                        <p>etc. Today’s class was pretty interesting. 
Our remix group was assigned today. I took the lead role and decided to contact all the group mates and bring us together. In class we decided to choose what topic we planned on doing. So we decided to pick franko’s cell phone cultural analysis. We found it to be the most simple and easiest project to do. We thought that recording people on their phones and walking around spotting people on their phones would be really easy. After class I texted everyone to meet up at the library the following day and we would work on the script for the documentary. It went well and it was fast. We spent about thirty minutes together and split up the parts between each other. I got a good amount of information from frank and it was pretty easy to do. 
</p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #12 Remix final</h1>
                        <p>The last remix project meeting we had is when I got all the videos together and edited it. It didn’t take too long as I was really good with computers. I used Sony Vegas which I have used before but it was a trial version so the little icon at the bottom kept popping up which was slightly annoying when posting the final project.  Our documentary went well we split the parts evenly and I used a slide show to present our topic and also we had people interviewed and we recorded them and put it in the video. It turned out pretty good and I was satisfied with it. </p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #13 Course Retrospective</h1>
                        <p>Today we were given a topic to write the course retrospective. Which is an overview about how we would give advice to incoming students. This was really simple to write as it was just how we thought about the class and how it can be approved. It is also about what we can look back and what have we learned. When analyzing what we did it was pretty clear on what we can tell to incoming students and what to expect. The course was very easy and very helpful to my learning abilities. It also got me to use my resources like the writing help center and it was really cool to take this course.</p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #14 Web design group </h1>
                        <p>Today I spent time with my web design group on the page. We asked people to send in their submissions as soon as possible but have yet to receive them so hopefully things work out. I spent a lot of time working the back ground and having it so the words don’t blend in the back. Also I learned a little bit more about a css style page better and how all the other pages refer back to css page on how to design the website. Our web design group made an msu photo the background and changed the blocks where people click on the tabs to each part. It turned out really good looking and I was really happy with the way it ended. We just need people to send in their parts to add on the page.</p>
                        <h1 Blog Entry #15 Final day of class</h1>
                        <p>The last day of class was somewhat unexciting but it gave time for groups to get together. We don’t have class on the finals so we will have to meet up with our groups after class. Hopefully some things get done. I signed up for the web design group as it was my favorite thing to do this year. It also seemed very fun to do. This time someone else contacted me to meet up so that was pretty cool. Out of the 6 only 3 of us worked on it. There was one guy that just signed up and didn’t even talk to us at all. I was kind of mad about that.  Wra in my opinion was alright. Nothing amazing but I had a good experience. </p>
