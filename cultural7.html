			<p>In conclusion League of Legends is a fun and exciting game that provides entertainment for many. It also gives something for players and children to enjoy on free time but it is important to play with discretion. League of Legends is extremely popular and will continue to grow as time passes and technology gets better. To limit the number of hours playing games is an important step in giving people a better life and providing a better outlook for many lives. It will be able to reduce social withdrawals and give interest for other activities. This positive lifestyle will encourage people to communicate and will help constant problems that are caused from detachment. League of legends is a great game and helps remove stress but too much can be harmful and looking at possible treatments is important for the future. </p>
