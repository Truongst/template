			<h1>Interview</h1>
			<p>After looking into what it is like to have a job in radiology, the interview with Dr. David Patrick was exceptionally interesting. He is one of the leading radiologists in America, and Grand Rapids is the leading city for radiology and medicine. Dr. Patrick worked many long hours to reach where he is now but because of it he is able to redeem the rewards. When asked him about treatment of terminally ill patients he said, “It becomes normal, and after many years and I must understand that no one can control fate.” Gaining experience becomes valuable and the lessons that come with it, will teach radiologist what to expect. Furthermore lessons about his classes showed that college will be difficult and is a lot of work but it is a good feeling when completed. He also mentioned “the hardest part about becoming a radiologist is getting into medical school. If you are able to focus on what is at hand, you should have no problems.” The interview brought a lot of insight into radiology and what it was like to be a working physician at a hospital. </p>
