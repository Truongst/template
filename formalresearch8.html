			<h1>Interview</h1>
			<p>Interviewing Professor Dr. Erik Shapiro provided a lot of knowledge towards what the courses in radiology would be like. When asked about how difficult the courses were he said that “With all classes, it requires a lot of work and radiology is no different”. He graduated with a college degree in chemistry and says that it is one of the best majors to take as it prepares students for medical school well. The qualities gained from taking the difficult courses from the chemistry major teaches students about discipline and motivation. Another question asked was what would he consider to students who are not doing well their freshman year? He said that medical schools like looking at students with improvement and as long as you focus the follow years you should be fine. Also that students should always have a backup plan as medical school is extremely competitive only takes the best students. The interview with Professor Dr. Shapiro gave a lot of advice and very informative. </p>
