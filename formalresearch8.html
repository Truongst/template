			<h1>What happens after school?</h1>
			<p>After medical school there are a lot of aspects in the career, there is residency and specialization. Previously mentioned residency is considered the most important part of learning about radiology. It provide a lot of on hand experience to new radiologist and teaches students situational events. The decision making during residency is more critical as students will work with more patients. Students typically spend eight to ten hours a day and about 55 hours a week which includes one or two call shifts a week. During residency students are required to take more hours outside reading than many other specialties in health care but that also depends on where the student works. As time passes the work load changes and things get easier because it becomes normal. After residency radiologist typically live well because of their high salary. Furthermore they get a lot of vacation hours and time off because of the mentally demanding schedule. In a personal statement physician Matthew D. Rifkin faces a lot of financial pressures and large workloads. He takes multiple 16 hour shifts and spends many hours reading a screen, he also mentions that the job is repetitive and mentally straining. Radiology is not an easy job which is why the pay is extremely high and because of it students who are working towards radiology must be prepared to make sacrifices and work hard for their entire lives.  Continuing on what it was like to actually be a radiologist an interview with Dr. David Patrick was conducted and found to be exceptionally interesting. He is one of the leading radiologists in America, and Grand Rapids is the leading city for radiology and medicine. Dr. Patrick worked many long hours to reach where he is now but because of it he is able to redeem the rewards. When asked him about treatment of terminally ill patients he said, “It becomes normal, and after many years and I must understand that no one can control fate.” Gaining experience becomes valuable and the lessons that come with it, will teach radiologist what to expect. Furthermore lessons about his classes showed that college will be difficult and is a lot of work but it is a good feeling when completed. He also mentioned “the hardest part about becoming a radiologist is getting into medical school. If you are able to focus on what is at hand, you should have no problems.” The interview brought a lot of insight into radiology and what it was like to be a working physician at a hospital. </p>
