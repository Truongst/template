			<h1>Economics of Radiology</h1>
			<p>Radiology is an extremely quick growing field and finding a job after schooling would be simple. The reward in becoming a radiologist is extremely high and is one of the highest paying jobs in the medical field. According to HealthSalaries.com in 2013 the United States the average radiologist salary is about $216,577 a year yet is depends on the geographic region. Also experience plays a factor in the pay rate, usually every five years the annual salary will go up. On average radiologist with under five yearsâ€™ work experience is about $157,909 a year, around $14 to $31 an hour which is an incredible amount (Healthcaresalaries2014). Including job experience, another factor is the specialty, MRI research or interventional radiologist make more than a normal radiologist. Living as a radiologist would be very stable and provide a very good source of income and because of it would be a very good career to pursue.</p>
